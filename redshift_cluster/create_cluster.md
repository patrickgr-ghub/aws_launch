## Create Redshift Cluster through IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
###### Version 1.0 - November 2020

#### 1.0 Getting Started - What is IaC?

<p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[1] The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches. (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).</p>

<p>Now that we have the technical definition out of the way, in short: IaC allows people to spin up, pause, and delete machines to process a targeted set of operations without having to use the command line interface (CLI). This allows data engineers to save time, increase consistency, and even bid out use of elastic infrastructure... utimately saving money.</p>
