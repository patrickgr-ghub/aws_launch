## Introduction to SSH Authentication

<p>For those that are newer to Cloud Database Management, the concept of SSH may be unfamiliar. This document reviews the purpose and application of the basic concepts of SSH Authentication.</p>

#### What is SSH?

<p>As defined on Wikipedia:

SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. SSH is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used on Microsoft Windows. Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.
